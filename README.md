# Full-Stack Developer Roadmap

First of all this guide is not complete and I'll expand it in more time. This guide is just cumulation of my knowledge about Web and Web related learning resources.

### First Steps

1. You should start to learn how web works. What internet actually is and understand how our computers communicate with internet.
2. Learn internet protocols and where they are used. HTTP, TCP/IP, FTP etc..
3. Lastly learn how browsers work and what is DNS.
