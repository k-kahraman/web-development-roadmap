# Full-Stack Developer Roadmap

First of all this guide is not complete and I'll expand it in more time. This guide is just cumulation of my knowledge about Web and Web related learning resources.

## First Steps

1. You should start to learn how web works. What internet actually is and understand how our computers communicate with internet.
2. Learn internet protocols and where they are used. HTTP, TCP/IP, FTP etc..
3. Lastly learn how browsers work and what is DNS.

## Basics: HTML/CSS and JavaScript

After you understand how internet and browers work. Start learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics. Try to write few basic websites, and when you are comfortable with the basics move to the second stage.

Here are some really good resources to get you started:
* [Udacity Intro HTML and CSS (Free)](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-html-and-css--ud001)
* [Udacity Intro JavaScript (Free)](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803)
* [Learn Web Development by Mozilla (Free)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
* [FreeCodeCamp (Free)](freecodecamp.org)
* [Codecademy (Paid but some courses are free)](https://www.codecademy.com)

## Intermediate: Pure JavaScript and Front-End Framework

JavaScript is a *huge* part of modern internet and becoming more comfortable with JavaScript is more meaningful then ever. I highly recommend you getting into advanced JavaScript stuff and learn everything about JavaScript.

Pick a package manager (I recommend **Node.js** or **npm** in other words) and start using a framework such as React, Vue, Angular etc. After you are comfortable with front-end framework write few small projects and move to next stage. I highly recommend learning React.

You can either buy a course from Udacity (expensive but more worth it) or you can freely go to freeCodeCamp or you can buy a monthly subscription for codecademy.com (cheaper than  Udacity with good education but no certification). 

I'm going to provide only few links from now on that. I want you to research and learn on your own.

## Upper-Intermediate: Back-End and Databases

Pick a programming language (JavaScript, Python, Java etc.) and I **recommend** JavaScript. And a database *MongoDB* also recommended because of libraries provided for MongoDB is plenty and easy to use. After that learn a back-end framework (Express, Spring Boot, Django etc.) and understand how APIs work especially **RESTful API**. Learn how database speaks with back-end. After some projects and you are comfortable move to next stage. 

You can learn these from Udacity, freeCodeCamp or codecademy.com But there is a really good Full-Stack Nanodegree that I highly recommend teaches you both Back-End and Full-Stack.

## Advanced: Full-Stack and Beyond!

Now you should be comfortable with both front and back parts of the website. Now it is time for a big project to start writing. Write a fully functional website entirely written by you and learn how to host and publish it. Also learn how scale and maintain it if needed. You can get help from someone to practice teamwork, also working with someone will increase your commitment to the project.

Another really good Full-Stack Nanodegree from Udacity that teaches Python framework. Buy either this one or JavaScript one **don't get both!**
